# SHH-circuit-matrix-simulation

An electrical circuit can be identified with its 'circuit laplacian' - $J$.
For a $N$ node circuit, the $J$ matrix is defined as $J(i , j) = -C_{i,j}$ when $i \neq j$ and $J(i,i) = \sum\limits_{j \neq i} c_{i,j}$. 
The circuital equation in this formalism is given as; 
$$V = JI$$ 
where $V$ and $I$ are node voltage and current column vectors.
